# Weather-Dashboard
Application providing a weather outlook for multiple cities


## User Story

AS A traveler
I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly


## Acceptance Criteria

I will have met the brief when the following acceptance criteria are met:

The app should consist of the following:

* Create a weather dashboard with form inputs.
  * When a user searches for a city they are presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
  * When a user views the current weather conditions for that city they are presented with:
    * The city name
    * The date
    * An icon representation of weather conditions
    * The temperature
    * The humidity
    * The wind speed
  * When a user view future weather conditions for that city they are presented with a 5-day forecast that displays:
    * The date
    * An icon representation of weather conditions
    * The temperature
    * The humidity
  * When a user click on a city in the search history they are again presented with current and future conditions for that city
